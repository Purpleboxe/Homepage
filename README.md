## Conclusion

This simple project helped me better make my websites more accessible to different screen sizes and also taught me how to make my website be more accessible in general. I tried my best to make the website follow the best accessibility practices. In all I think this little project was a good experience. This was made for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-advanced-html-and-css-homepage#solutions)
