## Conclusion

This simple project taught me how to make websites more accessible to different screen sizes and also comply to the best accessibility practices. In all I think this project was a good experience as it showed me how accessibility to websites can be very important. This was made for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-advanced-html-and-css-homepage#solutions).
